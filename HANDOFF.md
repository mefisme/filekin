# HANDOFF.md — Filekin

## Purpose

Shared handoff state for Codex, Claude Code, and other implementation agents.

Keep this document current enough that another agent can continue the project without relying on chat history.

## Current Phase

**Main-branch governance is active; the production terminal-host boundary (ConPTY) is implemented behind the shell/terminal abstractions.**

The public repository is live at `https://github.com/mefisme/filekin`. `main` is now protected by an active repository ruleset. The clean production solution contains platform-neutral shell/location/terminal contracts, an asynchronous persistent PowerShell runspace adapter, and a ConPTY-backed terminal-host service. No terminal renderer or WPF product surface has been built yet; that was intentionally kept out of the terminal-host service task.

## Current Product Identity

- Name: **Filekin**
- Category: keyboard-first Windows file manager + terminal
- License direction: GNU GPLv3
- Distribution: traditional installer + portable ZIP
- Runtime deployment: self-contained .NET

## GitHub Repository

- Public repository: `https://github.com/mefisme/filekin`
- Default branch: `main`
- Initial commit: `caba0d8` (`chore: establish Filekin production foundation`)
- GitHub recognizes the license as GPL-3.0.
- `.github/` contains SHA-pinned secretless Windows CI, `CODEOWNERS`, a PR template, and weekly Dependabot configuration for GitHub Actions and NuGet.
- Initial CI run `32869871853`: passed restore, Release build, all tests, and formatting verification.
- **Active branch protection**: repository ruleset `main` (id `21453006`), enforcement `active`, targeting the default branch. Rules: pull-request required with `required_approving_review_count = 1`, `require_code_owner_review = false`, `require_extra_approval_for_unattributed_changes = false`; required status check `Build, test, and format (Windows)` bound to the GitHub Actions app (`integration_id 15368`); block deletion and non-fast-forward. Bypass actor: repository admin role (`actor_id 5`, `bypass_mode always`) as the owner emergency bypass so the solo owner is not locked out.
- **CODEOWNERS is review routing only**, not a mandatory gate: `require_code_owner_review` is deliberately false so code-owner paths route review requests without adding a second required approval beyond the one requested review.

## Immediate Next Task

Wire the validated pieces together behind a non-UI command-routing service in `Filekin.Core`: classify command-bar input into the finite runspace path vs. the known-interactive ConPTY terminal path (see `CommandRouting` in the spike for the proven shape), and connect `PowerShellRunspaceBackend` and `ConPtyTerminalHost` through it. Provider-delegation `ShellTerminalLaunchRequest`s already flow out of the runspace backend and now have a terminal host to consume them. Still do not build a terminal renderer, keyboard protocol, scrollback, or WPF surface — those are the following phase.

## Spike Status

**Complete on the test machine.**

- Disposable project: `spikes/ShellTerminalSpike/`
- Automated result: **25 passed, 0 failed**
- Evidence: `spikes/ShellTerminalSpike/artifacts/latest-results.json`
- Final environment: Windows 10.0.26200 x64, .NET runtime 10.0.10, workspace-local SDK 10.0.400, Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK 7.6.5, external PowerShell 7.6.4, Python 3.13.15
- This is validation code only and is not a production Filekin scaffold.

## Findings

### What Worked

1. **Persistent PowerShell runspace**
   - One hosted runspace preserved `$x = "hello"` for a later `Write-Output $x` invocation.
   - Aliases, functions, and an imported module remained available across separate executions.
   - `InitialSessionState.CreateDefault2()`, `RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace(...)`, and repeated `PowerShell.Invoke()` against the same runspace were sufficient for the proof.

2. **Files → PowerShell location synchronization**
   - The minimal test UI changed its visible `FILES LOCATION` and set the runspace with `Set-Location -LiteralPath`.
   - The runspace reported the matching FileSystem provider path.
   - `Environment.CurrentDirectory` did not change, proving that process-wide current directory is not required as the primary state model.

3. **PowerShell → Files location synchronization**
   - `cd ..` / `Set-Location` results were read from the runspace's `PathInfo` after command completion and updated the visible test location.
   - The manual UI pass showed `D:\GitHub\filekin\spikes\ShellTerminalSpike` changing to `D:\GitHub\filekin\spikes` after `ps cd ..`.

4. **Non-filesystem provider detection**
   - `Set-Location HKLM:\` reliably produced provider `Registry` and path `HKLM:\`.
   - The test restored the runspace to the prior Files filesystem path immediately, preserving the no-divergence rule.
   - The manual UI displayed `ROUTE TO TERMINAL: provider=Registry; path=HKLM:\` while Files remained at its prior filesystem location.

5. **Finite native commands**
   - `where.exe git` returned stdout and exit code 0.
   - `git status` (run from this non-Git directory) returned stderr and exit code 128; this was an intentional available-machine substitution that proved failure capture.
   - A purpose-built native probe independently proved stdout capture, stderr capture, and a nonzero exit code of 7.

6. **ConPTY terminal session**
   - The path `test terminal surface → ConPTY → PowerShell` worked with UTF-8 pipe input/output.
   - `ResizePseudoConsole(100, 30)` was observed inside PowerShell as `100x30` through `$Host.UI.RawUI.WindowSize`.
   - PowerShell was the root process created with `STARTUPINFOEX` and `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE`.

7. **Interactive child lifecycle**
   - Python 3.13.15 was used because it was installed and stable for automation.
   - `python -q` launched inside the ConPTY-backed root PowerShell, accepted input, and emitted output.
   - `exit()` returned to the same PowerShell, which accepted another command.
   - `exit` in root PowerShell ended the root process/session.

8. **Routing proof**
   - `where.exe git` classified to the finite runspace/result path.
   - bare `python` classified to the ConPTY PowerShell terminal path.
   - `python script.py` classified to the finite path, proving that simple argument-sensitive rules are feasible.

### Failures Encountered and Resolved

- The first ConPTY launch inherited the parent process's redirected stdout instead of using the pseudoconsole output pipe. This reproduced a Windows standard-handle duplication edge case documented by Microsoft Terminal maintainers.
- Setting `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES` while leaving `hStdInput`, `hStdOutput`, and `hStdError` null forced the child to establish standard I/O through ConPTY. After this change, every ConPTY check passed.
- ConPTY pipe handles created by `CreatePipe` are synchronous. Constructing `FileStream` with `isAsync: true` failed. The working implementation uses synchronous handles while servicing input and output on separate tasks/threads as Microsoft recommends.

### Lifecycle / ConPTY Constraints

- ConPTY communication channels must be serviced independently to avoid full-buffer deadlocks.
- Output must continue to be drained through teardown; `ClosePseudoConsole` can emit a final frame.
- `ClosePseudoConsole` terminates attached console clients. Product shutdown should still follow the specified graceful-first policy before using pseudoconsole closure as final teardown.
- A terminal renderer must interpret VT/ANSI sequences; a plain text output control is not sufficient. The spike captures raw VT output and intentionally does not attempt to become a production renderer.

### Unexpected Interactivity Findings

Observed finite-path behavior depends on the host environment:

- In the headless/WPF-like automated path, the unknown native helper saw redirected stdin, received EOF immediately, and exited with a failure code. It had no usable terminal input channel.
- In a manual console-hosted path, the helper saw non-redirected stdin but the Files-style command surface could not reliably deliver input to it; it waited until its self-timeout. Input sent during that wait was later consumed by the parent test UI.

What can be detected reliably:

- executable/argument matches in a deterministic registry before process creation,
- explicit user choice before process creation,
- command completion, output/error streams, and native exit code afterward,
- final runspace provider/location after a PowerShell command completes.

What cannot be detected reliably:

- whether an arbitrary unknown executable will later request terminal input,
- whether a quiet/running process is waiting for input versus doing legitimate finite work,
- whether argument combinations become interactive without tool-specific knowledge.

Promotion finding:

- ConPTY association is supplied to `CreateProcessW` through `STARTUPINFOEX` and `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE` at process creation time.
- No documented supported API attaches an already-running finite-path native process to a newly created ConPTY session.
- A running process therefore cannot realistically be promoted in place. Routing must happen before process creation, or the command must be stopped/allowed to fail and then launched again as a fresh process in a terminal.

Recommended fallback for architecture review:

- route known interactive invocations before creation,
- give finite-path native commands no synthetic interactive stdin,
- when an unknown command fails/hangs in a way the user identifies as interactive, offer an explicit fresh `Run in terminal` relaunch,
- do not claim that the already-running process or its state was promoted.

### Architecture Review

The core proposed architecture is validated:

```text
Files command bar → persistent PowerShell runspace → finite result
terminal tab      → ConPTY → root PowerShell → interactive child
```

No fundamental replacement architecture is recommended. Production implementation should carry forward these evidence-based constraints:

1. Use `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES` with null standard handles when creating the ConPTY root process, especially from a GUI or redirected host.
2. Drain ConPTY input/output independently and through teardown.
3. Route interactive tools before process creation; fallback is fresh relaunch, not live promotion.
4. Detect runspace provider after every command and immediately restore the Files filesystem location if the result is non-filesystem.
5. Treat non-filesystem terminal delegation as creation of a new root PowerShell initialized to the detected provider location; do not imply that the in-process runspace itself moved into ConPTY.

## Unresolved Engineering Questions

The spike resolved the feasibility questions above. The owner confirmed the two resulting decisions on 2026-08-25.

## Handoff Template

Agents should update the sections below before stopping meaningful work.

### Last Agent
Claude Code — 2026-08-25.

### Work Completed
Applied the owner-confirmed `main` branch governance as an active GitHub repository ruleset, then implemented the production terminal-host boundary. Added platform-neutral terminal contracts to `Filekin.Core` (`ITerminalHost`, `ITerminalSession`, `TerminalSessionRequest`, size/output/exit types) and a ConPTY-backed implementation in `Filekin.Infrastructure.Windows` (`ConPtyTerminalHost`, `ConPtyTerminalSession`, `PowerShellExecutableLocator`, LibraryImport interop). PowerShell is the root process; input, output (raw VT bytes), resize, exit notification, and teardown all sit behind the boundary. No renderer or WPF surface was added. The ConPTY lifecycle was re-verified against the current Microsoft "Creating a Pseudoconsole session" documentation before implementation.

### Tests / Validation
- Production Release build (`Filekin.sln`): passed, 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- Production tests: passed, 12/12 (2 core unit, 5 Windows runspace integration, 5 new ConPTY terminal-host integration).
- Production `dotnet format Filekin.sln --verify-no-changes --no-restore`: passed (exit 0).
- New terminal-host coverage: executable resolution, input→output round-trip through ConPTY, `ResizePseudoConsole` observed by PowerShell `RawUI` (120x40), one-shot startup command runs and the `-NoExit` shell prompt remains, and `exit` ends the root process while raising `Exited` with an exit code.
- Branch ruleset verified via the GitHub API: PR review count 1, code-owner review false, unattributed-changes extra approval false, required check `Build, test, and format (Windows)` bound to the GitHub Actions app, deletion/non-fast-forward blocked, owner admin bypass present.

### Known Problems
- `ConPtyTerminalSession` builds the root command line as `"<pwsh>" -NoLogo -NoExit -Command "Set-Location …; <CommandText>"`. The startup `CommandText` is appended verbatim; commands containing embedded double quotes are out of scope for v1 (known interactive tools are simple tokens). A dedicated argument/quoting model is future work.
- Auto-launching the interactive tool via `-Command` differs slightly from the spike, which launched the child by typing it at the prompt after a readiness marker. The `-Command` path is validated for PowerShell and a benign startup command; it should still be exercised against a real TUI (claude/codex) once a terminal surface exists.
- The output boundary emits raw VT/ANSI bytes only. No terminal renderer, keyboard protocol, scrollback, or accessibility layer exists yet (intentionally out of this task).
- `Filekin.App` still intentionally opens no window and exits immediately.
- The finite shell result contract still captures success/error streams as completed string collections; streaming output, other PowerShell streams, native exit status, and result presentation remain unimplemented.
- `Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK` brings a substantial runtime dependency graph; publishing/trimming/self-contained packaging behavior still needs production validation.

### Recommended Next Step
Implement the non-UI command-routing service described under **Immediate Next Task**, connecting `PowerShellRunspaceBackend` and `ConPtyTerminalHost`. Keep renderer/WPF work in the phase after that.

## Product Questions Requiring Owner Decision

Record genuinely unspecified user-visible/product/architecture decisions here rather than silently choosing them.

- **Hosted terminal PowerShell profile — decided 2026-08-25.** Default is **load the profile** (`TerminalSessionRequest.LoadProfile = true`), so a hosted tab behaves like the user's real shell; new users are unaffected because a fresh PowerShell has no profile. It becomes a **user setting** (load vs. skip) when the settings system exists, with load remaining the default; a "skip profile" toggle serves users who want a clean, fast, can't-break shell. No code change needed now — the flag already exists. Tests pin `LoadProfile = false` for determinism.
- **Command-bar `@` vs. PowerShell's own `@` — open.** In the Files command bar, `@` is Filekin reference syntax and is resolved before the text reaches the shell (DECISIONS.md, 2026-08-24). But `@` is also native PowerShell (splatting `@args`, arrays `@()`, hashtables `@{}`, here-strings `@"..."@`). The exact rule that tells a Filekin `@reference` apart from a native PowerShell `@` in raw command-bar input is not yet specified. Decide the disambiguation rule when building the command bar. This is independent of any user profile and does not affect terminal tabs (which get no `/`/`@` preprocessing). No conflict exists in terminal tabs.
- **Does the command-bar runspace load the user's PowerShell profile? — open.** Terminal tabs load the profile (decided above), but the persistent command-bar runspace currently does not (it uses `InitialSessionState.CreateDefault2()`, which does not run `$PROFILE`). Decide whether the command bar should reflect the user's profile aliases/functions, or intentionally stay a clean, predictable session. Note that not loading it also reduces the chance of a profile-defined command colliding with `/`/`@` handling.

Confirmed by the owner on 2026-08-25:

- Unknown interactive fallback is a one-time fresh **Run in terminal** relaunch. There is no live promotion and no persistent user-defined routing rule in v1.
- Non-filesystem provider delegation creates a fresh ConPTY-backed PowerShell at the requested provider path. Files retains/restores its filesystem runspace location, and arbitrary runspace state is not transferred.
